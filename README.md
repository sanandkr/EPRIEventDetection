# EPRI_EventDetection
Anomaly-aware Compressive Sampler (ACS), our compression algorithm for electrical signal data operates by identifying events and adjusting the sampling frequency "locally" in the absence of high frequency events. Here, we exhibit the result of the anomaly detection block of the algorithm executed on the publicly available DOE/EPRI National Database Repository of Power System Events data. Circles mark the places where the algorithm detects events. The parameters of the algorithm are prespecified for a given sampling frequency.
